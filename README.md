# belly-button-challenge
This project is an interactive dashboard that visualizes microbiome data using D3.js and Plotly.js. The dashboard displays sample metadata, a bar chart of the top 10 bacterial cultures, and a bubble chart of all OTUs found per sample. The application is deployed using GitHub Pages for free static hosting.

1. **Data & Analysis**
    - Used a provided JSON dataset of microbiome samples.
    - Analyzed and manipulated the data using JavaScript and D3.js.

2. **Dashboard Features**
    - Populated a dropdown menu with sample IDs.
    - Displayed sample metadata in a panel using D3.js.
    - Built an interactive bar chart (top 10 bacteria) and bubble chart (all OTUs) using Plotly.js.
    - Updated charts and metadata dynamically when the user selects a new sample.

3. **Deployment Steps**
    - Created an `index.html` file for the dashboard and linked required JavaScript and CSS files.
    - Initialized a local git repository and committed all project files.
    - Pushed the repository to GitHub.
    - Deployed the dashboard by enabling GitHub Pages in the repository settings.
